                A dolphin is an aquatic mammal within the infraorder Cetacea. Dolphin species belong to the families 
                Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the New World 
                river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese 
                river dolphin). There are 40 extant species named as dolphins. Dolphins range in size from the 
                1.7-metre-long (5 ft 7 in) and 50-kilogram (110-pound) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and 
                10-tonne (11-short-ton) orca. Various species of dolphins exhibit sexual dimorphism where the males 
                are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. 
                Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can briefly travel at speeds of 29 kilometres 
                (18 mi) per hour or leap about 30 feet (9.1 m).[1] Dolphins use their conical teeth to capture 
                fast-moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water. It is so 
                well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving 
                to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.

                The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
                terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one 
                species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing 
                them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, 
                as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.

                Parrots, also known as psittacines, are birds of the roughly 398 species[3] in 92 genera comprising
                the order Psittaciformes, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. 
                The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea ("true" parrots), the Cacatuoidea 
                (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot species are threatened 
                by extinction, with higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable 
                bird group.[4] Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate 
                regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.
